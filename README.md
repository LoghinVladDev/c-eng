### Introduction

Game Engine Project. Started as a port from a small Java 2D game engine, turned into a 
3D engine in C++ OpenGL/Vulkan

### Compilation

The engine is currently in development for Windows/Linux. Only requires 
OS libraries, no need for external APIs. 

Indev compilation : 
 * Linux : GCC and Clang.
 * Windows : MinGW-w64. Not tested in MVSC
 
Compilation guide TBD, for now use CMake

The project is developed only by me at the moment, if for any reason you plan
to build / use this, keep in mind that most targets will not work (for now)

### Usage

Documentation TBA at a much later date
