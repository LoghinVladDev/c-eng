Execution Model
    - Physical Device [1..n]
        - QueueFamily [1..n]
            - Queue [1..n] ( sync/async to each other )
        - Work ( Tasks ) for Queue Families
            - Queues in QueueFamily can execute Work designed for Family
            - Work is defined as
                - Video Encode
                - Video Decode
                - Graphics
                - Compute
                - Transfer
                - Sparse Memory Management

        - Memory Managed by Host
        - One or more Heaps
        - Different Areas
        - Heap is Device / Host Local
        - Device Sees all Memory

    - Work submitted to queues
        - can take list of semaphores to wait for until start of command
        - can take list of semaphores to signal once command finished
        - no order constraints for commands on different queues, queues & host
        - command buffer work on single queue respects submission order, but may overlap execution
        - other type of work on single queue / batches have no ordering constraints
        - additional constraints expressed with semaphores & fences
        - explicit commands available

    - Commands recorder in buffers
        - Actions:
            - Draw
            - Dispatch
            - Clear
            - Copy
            - Query/Timestamp
            - Begin/End subpass operations
        - Set States:
            - Bind Pipelines
            - Bind Descriptor Sets
            - Bind Buffers
            - Set Dynamic State
            - Set Push Constants
            - Set Render Pass / Subpass State
        - Perform Sync:
            - Set / Wait Events
            - Pipeline Barrier
            - Render Pass / Subpass Dependencies
        - Some commands perform more than one task
            - State commands update state of buffer
            - Some Action commands ( draw/dispatch ) perform based on state
                - set cumulatively since start of buffer
            - Action commands can overlap, or be reordered, but this must not alter the current state used by actions
            - Actions commands alter framebuffer attachments, r/w buffer or image memory / write to query pools
            - Sync commands - explicit execution & memory dependencies between two sets of action commands
            - In a sync command, the second set depends on the first

    Objects obtained from vkDevice are private to device

    Creation
        - Low frequency, large time consumption
    Allocation
        - High frequency, low time consumption

    Pools -> created, Buffers -> allocated

    Create -> destroy
    Allocate -> free

    3 exceptions :
           - VkShaderModule
           - VkPipelineCache
           - VkValidationCacheEXT
      - not to be destroyed / freed

    While in pending, do not destroy
        Event, QueryPool, Buffer, BufferView, Image, ImageView, Pipeline, Sampler, SamplerYcbcrConversion, Framebuffer
        RenderPass, CommandBuffer, CommandPool, DeviceMemory, DescriptorSet, IndirectCommandsLayoutNV, AccelerationStructureNV
        AccelerationStructureKHR

    While queue executes commands, if used in execution, do not destroy
        Fence, Semaphore, CommandBuffer, CommandPool

    Parents not to be destroyed before children
        CommandPool - parentOf -> CommandBuffer
        DescriptorPool - parentOf -> DescriptorSet
        Device - parentOf -> * objects that use device at creation

    Restrictions
        Queue cannot be explicitly Destroyed. Implicitly Destroyed when Device is Destroyed
        Pool destruction deletes obects allocated in said pool
